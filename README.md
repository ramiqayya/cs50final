# CS50 Final Project
## final project
my final project is a website service to sell and buy cars using html, python,flask and sqlite3 for database. I have also used bootstrap and css for styles.

The first time the user tries to enter the home page the website will asked the user to enter username and password. For that you can enter register page from the navbar at the top you will be asked to register a new username and enter the password twice correctly.

After you register a new username and password you can now be able to sign into the website. The first thing you will see is the hompage "index page showing all the cars offered by other users for sale". Each car card should a picture for the car, name of the seller, year of manufacture, milage, the price of the car and at the bottom there is a button for sending request for the seller if you wish to buy the car. 

## Sending a purchase request
You can send a purchase request from (Sending purchase request) button at the bottom of each car card. Once you press the button the button will be deactivated and a request will be send to the seller of the car. the request also will be added in the database until the seller of the car decide to approve or reject his car purchase request. If your request is approved buy the seller a notification will appear at the top of the index page notifying you that your request is approved by the seller and which car is approved.

## Adding a new car Ad
you can add a new car Advirtisement for selling your car by chosing (Sell Car) button at the navbar on the top. once you click that
